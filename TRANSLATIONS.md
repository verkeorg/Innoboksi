You are welcome to translate The Innobox.

We only ask you to make available publicly.

**Help**
A possibly way to translate the posters:

1. [clone the repository](https://github.com/verkeorg/innoboksi/english)
2. translate them
3. Add 2 or 3 letter language code to the end of each poster - e.g. "poster_canvas_de.pdf"
4. send a pull request so we can merge them, or tell us where they are.

If you have any questions, just ask!
